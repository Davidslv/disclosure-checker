      DBS checks are criminal record checks.
      If you’re applying for a job, university, college or insurance, you may be told a DBS check is needed.
      You should also be told what type of check will be done.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Criminal record checks are usually done through the Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS).

      ‘<a class="govuk-link" rel="external" target="_blank" href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dbs-filtering-guidance">protected</a>’

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>Basic - shows only cautions and convictions that are not spent.</li>
      <li>Standard - shows all convictions, cautions, reprimands and final warnings, even if they’re spent</li>
      <li>Enhanced - shows the same information as a standard check but also includes any information held by the police that they think is relevant to your application.</li>
      <li>Enhanced with barred list - shows the same information as an enhanced check but also tells employers if you’ve been barred from doing the role you’re applying for.</li>
