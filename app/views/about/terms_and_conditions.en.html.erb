    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">About the service</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body"><%= service_name -%> is a service provided by the Ministry of Justice (MoJ).</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">Its purpose is to help users work out whether or not they need to tell organisations (such as employers, places of education or insurance companies) about a caution or conviction on their criminal record.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">The service gives users guidance on when a single caution or conviction becomes spent, according to the current law in England and Wales.</p>
    <div class="govuk-inset-text">
      If you have more than one conviction, the guidance the service gives may not apply to you.
    </div>

    <p class="govuk-body">The guidance may not apply if you:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>get another caution or conviction before an existing caution or conviction is spent</li>
      <li>are applying for certain jobs where you have to list all cautions or convictions even if they are spent</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How the service works</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">The service asks users for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>their age when cautioned or convicted</li>
      <li>the type of caution or conviction they were given</li>
      <li>any relevant dates and sentence lengths, if applicable</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">This information is checked against the current law and users are given the date the conviction becomes spent.</p>


    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m" id="using-guidance">How to use the information this service gives you</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">As the service does not ask for specific details about users’ criminal records, it can only give general guidance on when cautions or convictions become spent in England and Wales.</p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Our responsibilities</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">The result given at the end of the service is based on the information given by the service user.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">If the user enters any incorrect information, the result they are given will also be incorrect.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">MoJ is not responsible for:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>people disclosing spent cautions or convictions when they weren’t required to</li>
      <li>how and when employers ask for information about people’s criminal records</li>
    </ul>
